## Background & Objectives

The following aglorithm will sort a list of 10 numbers ranging between 1 to 100 in ascending order and remove any dublicates. The code was

## Ruby versions
- Ruby '3.1.2'

## Initial Setup
- Pull the project from this public repository.
- Clone repo `gh repo clone Wigwamwam/2i_test`
- Enter repo `cd 2i_test` via terminal
- Enter the lib file `cd /lib` via terminal
- Run file `ruby sort_list.rb` via terminal
- Output should print a sorted list numbers with no dublicates

## TDD
- Used Rspec for testing
- Created two tests 1.) checked whether the number generator return 10 values 2.) ensured no dublicates were contained within the list.
- To check whether the tests path go to the main folder and type `rspec`

## Further improvements
- Would have liked users to enter their own numbers.
